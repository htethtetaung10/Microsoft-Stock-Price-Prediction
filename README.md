# microsoft-stock-price-prediction
This project compares the performance of machine learning models and select the best model for the proposed  data. It predicts the closing price of Microsoft stocks using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression(LR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), KNeighbors Regressor (KNR) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The tools used in this project are Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, GridSearchCV and Keras Tuner.
